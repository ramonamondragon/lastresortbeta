INT. THE LAST RESORT - FRONT DESK
_We find Sophia and Ramona at the desk. It’s a quiet day, RAMONA’s sitting behind the desk, flipping through a magazine._

_SOPHIA is sitting on the desk, speaking to Mr. Bones._

SOPHIA:

Hey, Mr. B., I had a question. If living humans are technically immortal in The Vast, would I bleed if I cut my hand with a knife? Or would nothing happen?

SOPHIA:

_She gets up from the desk and walks off._

SOPHIA (CONT'D):

_Mr. Bones follows as well._

MR. BONES:

Ramona continues reading her magazine, barely paying attention.

RAMONA:

Mhm.

_A beat.
She looks up._

RAMONA (CONT'D):

Wait.
