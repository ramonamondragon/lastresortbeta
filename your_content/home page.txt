<ul>
    <li>Navigating The Vast, a.k.a. The Afterlife, a huge endless world with all sorts of biomes and creatures inhabiting it</li>
    <li>Helping their boss, Mr. Bones, run one of many hotels for people in the afterlife. There will be many shenanigans.</li>
    <li>Getting paid in <em>exposure</em>... TO FUN!</li>
    <li>Helping shapeless cute blobs decide what they want to look like in the afterlife.</li>
    <li><em>Dealing with and confronting their inner demons, haunting them at every turn.</em></li>
    <li>Fulfilling quests and requests for guest all around the Vast that are fun and cool and only sometimes potentially lethal.</li>
    <li><em>Fighting off the presence in the Afterlife out to get them, God knows why, please, they just want to do their job, they're just the employees.</em></li>
    <li>Being haunted by the ghostly grandma chef because they didn't finish their meal.</li>
    <li>And so much MORE!</li>
</ul>
