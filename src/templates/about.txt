<h1>Origins...</h1>
<p>The year is 2020. All over the globe, people have been staying inside their homes for months on end, trying their best to not fall prey to a global pandemic.</p>
<p>It's two AM. Two people sit in bed, aimlessly bouncing off ideas for a project. Their names aren't important. How they look like isn't important, either (but if it was important, rest assured, they are totally good-looking and fit). The only thing that matters is that so far they've only come up with a Ghost Grandma dating sim so, clearly, things are not going well.</p>
<p>"This prompt card says a bus. What about a creepy bus that just picks you up and takes you, I don't know, somewhere?"</p>
<p>"This one says your story should have a skeleton."</p>
<p>"<em>The skeleton is driving the bus."</em></p>
<p>"Where's he taking you?"</p>
<p>"... A hotel."</p>
<p>"A hotel? Why a hotel?"</p>
<p>"Because I just thought of the title 'The Last Resort' and it sounds badass. So one day, this bus rolls to a stop in front of you, Mr. Bones Dude comes out all 'hey, can you help me run this hotel' and you have nothing better to do that day, so you say sure."</p>
<p>"...Okay."</p>

<h3>Kate Hunt (she/her) - Lineart, colorist, and voted most artistic in high school</h3>
<p>Kate is a freelance artist based in Portland, OR, who claims her only redeeming is her sick artworks and her hot bod because the rest of her is a talented joke (affectionate). Initially a computer science major, she decided that hey, art is fun, so she switched to that because who even cares at this point. She also is a My Little Pony art chad.</p>
<p>Her roles in the comic include but are not limited to: line-arting and being the style for the comic, doing miscellaneous assets when needed, stopping Cayetana from posting on social media at 3 AM, reminding the team to drink water, social media work, picking amazing colors, and doing too much and then apologizing that she's not doing enough.</p>
